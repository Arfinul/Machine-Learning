"Elias Howe? Why, yes, I believe so. There are so many Howes here I
had to think a minute. You mean Elias, Jr., I guess. They did live
down in the south part. The young fellow had some scheme of sewing by
machinery. Couldn't make it work, I believe."
"Is his father living here?"
"No, not now. Another son invented a machine for cutting palm leaf into
strips for hats and Howe moved to Cambridge to help the thing along.
Don't believe he'll ever come back."
"My nephew and I saw young Howe in Boston four years ago with his
sewing machine. We've both been much interested to hear more about his
fortunes. Has he some relatives here who could tell us?"
"Why, yes, his uncle Tyler lives here, his father's brother. His house
is right over there. Better call on him. He's a pleasant fellow--every
Howe is--and he likes to talk."
"Shall we?" asked Uncle William of Jonathan.
Jonathan's feeling in the matter was not uncertain, but all he said
was, "I should like to, Uncle."
"Glad to see you both," was the hearty greeting of Mr. Tyler Howe, upon
hearing Uncle William's introduction of himself and his nephew. "Well,
Elias is a smart boy and a good one, but he's pretty well down on his
luck just now. So you saw him in Boston? Four years ago, wasn't it?
Since then he's had a discouraging time.
"After he exhibited his machine in the shop where you saw him, he
spent three or four months in Fisher's garret, making another machine
to deposit in the patent office. The next year he and Fisher went to
Washington, where they had no trouble in getting a patent, but no luck
at all in interesting people in the sewing machine. They exhibited it
once at a fair, but the crowd was amused, that's all.
