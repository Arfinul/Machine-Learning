CLASS_0.0/1	Elias Howe Why yes I believe so There are so many Howes here I
CLASS_0.0/2	had to think a minute You mean Elias Jr I guess They did live
CLASS_0.0/3	down in the south part The young fellow had some scheme of sewing by
CLASS_0.0/4	machinery Couldnt make it work I believe
CLASS_0.0/5	Is his father living here
CLASS_0.0/6	No not now Another son invented a machine for cutting palm leaf into
CLASS_0.0/7	strips for hats and Howe moved to Cambridge to help the thing along
CLASS_0.0/8	Dont believe hell ever come back
CLASS_0.0/9	My nephew and I saw young Howe in Boston four years ago with his
CLASS_0.0/10	sewing machine Weve both been much interested to hear more about his
CLASS_0.0/11	fortunes Has he some relatives here who could tell us
CLASS_0.0/12	Why yes his uncle Tyler lives here his fathers brother His house
CLASS_0.0/13	is right over there Better call on him Hes a pleasant fellowevery
CLASS_0.0/14	Howe isand he likes to talk
CLASS_0.0/15	Shall we asked Uncle William of Jonathan
CLASS_0.0/16	Jonathans feeling in the matter was not uncertain but all he said
CLASS_0.0/17	was I should like to Uncle
CLASS_0.0/18	Glad to see you both was the hearty greeting of Mr Tyler Howe upon
CLASS_0.0/19	hearing Uncle Williams introduction of himself and his nephew Well
CLASS_0.0/20	Elias is a smart boy and a good one but hes pretty well down on his
CLASS_0.0/21	luck just now So you saw him in Boston Four years ago wasnt it
CLASS_0.0/22	Since then hes had a discouraging time
CLASS_0.0/23	After he exhibited his machine in the shop where you saw him he
CLASS_0.0/24	spent three or four months in Fishers garret making another machine
CLASS_0.0/25	to deposit in the patent office The next year he and Fisher went to
CLASS_0.0/26	Washington where they had no trouble in getting a patent but no luck
CLASS_0.0/27	at all in interesting people in the sewing machine They exhibited it
CLASS_0.0/28	once at a fair but the crowd was amused thats all
CLASS_1.0/1	The principal monuments of the once powerful Iroquois are their myths
CLASS_1.0/2	and folklore with the language in which they are embodied As these
CLASS_1.0/3	monuments are fast crumbling away through their contact with European
CLASS_1.0/4	civilization the ethnologist must hasten his search among them in order
CLASS_1.0/5	to trace the history of their laws of mind and the records of their
CLASS_1.0/6	customs ideas laws and beliefs Most of these have been long
CLASS_1.0/7	forgotten by the people who continue to repeat traditions as they have
CLASS_1.0/8	been handed down through their fathers and fathers fathers from
CLASS_1.0/9	generation to generation for many centuries
CLASS_1.0/10	The pagan Iroquois of today and there are still many will tell you
CLASS_1.0/11	that his ancestors worshiped as he continues to do the Great Spirit
CLASS_1.0/12	and like himself held feasts and dances in his honor but a careful
CLASS_1.0/13	study of the mythology of these tribes proves very clearly that in the
CLASS_1.0/14	place of one prevailing great spirit the Indians earliest conception
CLASS_1.0/15	of the white mans God the Iroquois gods were numerous All the
CLASS_1.0/16	mysterious in nature all that which inspired them with reverence awe
CLASS_1.0/17	terror or gratitude became deities or beings like themselves endowed
CLASS_1.0/18	with supernatural attributes beings whose vengeance must be
CLASS_1.0/19	propitiated mercy implored or goodness recompensed by thankofferings
CLASS_1.0/20	The latter were in the form of feasts dances or incense
CLASS_2.0/1	IN war times after a battle or a long march how the soldiers enjoyed
CLASS_2.0/2	their coffee And in many cases it was pretty poor coffee too though
CLASS_2.0/3	to them it seemed fit for the gods The delicious aroma which arose
CLASS_2.0/4	made their feelings of weariness or depression vanish for a while and
CLASS_2.0/5	the beverage itself cheered them in a marked degree Nothing could take
CLASS_2.0/6	its place nothing can take its place today The consumption of coffee
CLASS_2.0/7	in this country is enormous Rich and poor alike must have it But it
CLASS_2.0/8	is a common complaint that a cup of good coffee is the exception rather
CLASS_2.0/9	than the rule Considering the low price of the raw material this
CLASS_2.0/10	should not be the case People are prone to think that they know all
CLASS_2.0/11	there is to be known about coffee and do not take pains to learn what
CLASS_2.0/12	special qualities different brands possess and what the most approved
CLASS_2.0/13	modes of making coffee are
CLASS_2.0/14	Time was when a Mexican or South or Central American coffee was
CLASS_2.0/15	considered an inferior article Today some of the best coffees come
CLASS_2.0/16	from these places For example one of the most delicious coffees
CLASS_2.0/17	which is brought into this country comes from Guatemala It bears the
CLASS_2.0/18	name of Las Nubes The Clouds which it takes from the plantation
CLASS_2.0/19	where it is grown There is an odd bit of history connected with this
CLASS_2.0/20	plantation A Scotchman named Nelson owned it and was coining money
CLASS_2.0/21	from it when he was banished from the country by President Barrios
CLASS_2.0/22	and his property was confiscated It is now owned by the widow of
CLASS_2.0/23	Barrios The annual yield from it is four hundred and fifty thousand
CLASS_2.0/24	pounds A large proportion of this goes to England where it brings a
CLASS_2.0/25	higher price than here
